# "Deep Learning - From Basics to Practice" by Andrew Glassner

## This directory is for archival purposes only

This directory holds resources for the first edition of the book. It was published
on Kindle and is no longer available.

## How to get the new book!

The new book, updated and much improved, is available from No Starch Press.

It's called [Deep Learning: A Visual Approach](https://nostarch.com/deep-learning-visual-approach) 
and is available in both physical and Ebook formats.

All of the figures and code for the new book are also available 
in a sibling Github repo. Just go up and level and you should find it!

## About the notebooks

These notebooks are only lightly documented.

Because of their role as learning materials, all of the code in these notebooks
was written to emphasize clarity over all other stylistic concerns. This means
that much of it can be shortened, and probably made faster as well. Feel free
to dig in, optimize, convert to other languages, or otherwise play with the code.  

All the notebooks are released under the MIT license. Informally, you're free to 
do pretty much anything with the code, including using it in your own projects,
or even including it in commercial projects, as long as you keep my copyright
along with the code. While I strove for accuracy and correctness, there is no 
warranty that the code is bug-free or fit for any purpose.

Some notebooks work with images. The images I used in the book are included
with the notebooks. See the section below on Figures for details on their
licensing, and see the book for the URL where each image may be found. All images
without an explicit citation in the book are by the author, and are released
under the MIT license.

## About the figures

Most of roughly 1000 figures are saved in PNG format
at high resolution (300 dpi or better), so
they are appropriate for presentations and talks even when projected
to large size.

All of these figures are released under the MIT license, like the code. This
means you're free to use them any way you like, as long as you keep the 
copyright associated with them somehow. Use them for your classes,
reports, papers, presentations, whatever you like!

You're not required to attribute me or the book if you use these images, 
but I'd appreciate it if you would. 

Some figures include photographs. Many of these are by the author. All other
photos are from Wikiart, Wikimedia, or Pixabay. The book provides a citation
and URL to the source of each of these images. The first two sites state that
their images are in the public domain. All images selected from Pixabay are 
labeled as released under the Creative Commons CC0 license, and explicitly
state, "Free for commercial use. No attribution required."

To help you better sort through and choose figures, thumbnails for all 
the figures are available.
